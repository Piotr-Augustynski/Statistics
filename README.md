# Statistics - training program

The Statistics program presents statistical data from a file. Currently accepts JSON and CSV files but you can easily add another file format.

The data in the files should look the same.

## Usage

1. Go directly to the program folder (statistics) in terminal
2. Paste the file with the correct scheme into a folder called reports
3. Run command

ruby bin/statistics file_name
```

The file name should contain the extension.
