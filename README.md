# Statistics - training program

The Statistics program accepts JSON and CSV files, but you can easily implement an additional file type. It converts them into one form and presents statistics based on the data that it reads from the file.


The data in the files should look like the same pattern.

The program presents 4 statistical data at the moment, but you can easily add further data.

## Usage

Get to the directly folder (statistics) in terminal.

```bash
ruby bin/statistics file_name
```

The file name should contain the extension.
